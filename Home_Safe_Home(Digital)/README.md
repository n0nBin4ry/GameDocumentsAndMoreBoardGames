Home, Safe Home (Global Game Jam 2019)
- A tower defense game where you protect your home from the elements
- I was Lead/Sole Designer
- The source and executable are in this repository: https://github.com/elbapotsnugg/GGJ2019
- The scope was a bit big for the jam, so we scoped it down and made a prototype instead
- If I decide to fully impliment my design one day (instead of focusing on newer projects), I will likely make it 2D and in GM2 or C++ w/ SDL
