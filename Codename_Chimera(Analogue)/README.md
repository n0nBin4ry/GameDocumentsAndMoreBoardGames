# Codename: Chimera

A Card-Based monster building game where players use 3 phases to create a custom monster to take out their competition. 

There are endless combinations of cards and their abilities, making each session unique!

## Files:
- In this repository you will find both the plain text and PDF (with art!) versions of the rulebook.
  - The PDF version is for a booklet so the first and last pages are the front and back covers, respectively.
- We also contain pngs of all the cards and a png of the card-back that goes on the back of all of them.
- When the game is officially published on GameCrafter, the link will be here. Though feel free to use these assets for a free version!

### Director & Rules Artist: Preston Taylor

### Producer & Rule-Compiler: Richard Flores

### Card Artists: Jorge Sandoval & Frankie SC

### Co-Designers: We all worked together to deisng the game and its systems.

#### Note: 
- Not only did we have part in designing the abilities/stats of the cards, but we also each contributed in the concept art of the cards. Though our Card Artists put in the finishing touches and had final say in the art of each card.
